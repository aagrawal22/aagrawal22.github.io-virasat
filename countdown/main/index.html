                    <p>An epitome of grace and surrealistic elegance in the sphere of Indian classical dance, Saswati Sen is a luminous figure in the Lucknow Gharana of Kathak Dance. With her swift pirouettes, unique rhythmic virtuosity and lyrical grace , Saswati Sen has woven an aura of  inexplicable charm in this regal dance form. Breaking her family's mould of legal and medical practitioners, she began her training of Kathak at Bharatiya Kala Kendra under Srimati Reba Vidyarthi. A recipient of the National Scholarship in Performing Arts, Saswati graduated to become a disciple of Kathak maestro Pandit Birju Maharaj. With  abhinaya being her prime focus, she has created a fusion of contemporary concepts with the splendour of traditional nritya that has today elevated Kathak from the regal confines of central India to the world stage. As the foremost disciple of Pt. Birju Maharaj, she has been pivotal in carrying forward his legacy. The driving force behind Pt. Birju Maharaj' s famed institute Kalashram , Saswati Sen has been ceaselessly working to popularise this magnificent dance form not only as a performer but also as a teacher. She has been travelling extensively throughout India and abroad conducting seminars, workshops and panel discussions, dessimating the knowledge she has garnered through decades of experience. A recipient of numerous prestigious awards like  Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, Sringar Mani Award, Sanskriti Award and Critics Recommendation Award, Saswati Sen is the very thread that holds together the Kathak community today. This VIRASAT, it is an honour to have her esteemed presence amongst us.</p>

                    <p>A star in the genre of Manipuri dance, Priti Patel has been turning heads and hearts with her powerful performances and bold choreography. With a comprehensive training and a performing experience of almost thirty years, Shrimati Priti Patel has emerged as an accomplished and committed artist in the Manipuri dance idiom. In November 1995, Patel laid the foundation of a unique school called "ANJIKA" in Kolkata.

Born on 28 February 1960 in Indore Madhya Pradesh, Patel was initiated into Manipuri dance at the age of 12 by Guru Bipin Singh, Darshana Jhaveri and Kalavati Devi. She studied the aesthetics of Manipuri dance under the guidance of Maharaj Kumari Binodini Devi. Her noted choreographic works include Malem - a Homage to Mother Earth, Khuman - The Black Sun, Agni - The Sacred Fire, and Surya Gati. 
Her school, ANJIKA, besides teaching Manipuri dance is also involved in Movement Therapy for children suffering from cerebral palsy. Surya Sekhar Basu, a student of ANJIKA and a special child suffering from Down Syndrome has been awarded the "Shri Umedqbhai Patel Award" for dance, a prize given to special children in this field. Anjika has performed in several prestigious dance shows all over the world and with the blessings of her Gurus they have won recognition and respect.
This VIRASAT let's delve into the finesse of Manipuri extravaganza with Shrimati Priti Patel and her troupe ANJIKA.</p>

                    <p>India is the land of origin of an enthralling arena of folk dance forms and songs. Yet, nowadays, we have almost lost track of these art forms which are embedded with the raw natural beauty of our country. Deen Mohammad and his troupe, has kept alive our magnificent roots through their fascinating tunes and performances. Originating in Balmer and Jaisalmer the manganiyar performers have recieved great accolades not only in India but also from around the globe. 
These performers, comprising of men in traditional Rajasthani attires and women in their vibrant majestic ghagras speak of a time bygone, in rich, melodious tones. They fill us with a deep seated longing to go back to our origins, even while swaying to their lively yet serene tunes. The female performers mostly perform ghummar and bhawai resonating with ancient glory. The all captivating and intriguing symphony of their simple music have captured the imagination of movie directors through generations, leading to songs such as ‘Kesariya balam', 'Nimbuda' and the most recent 'Ghoomar'. 

This VIRASAT , we feel highly honoured to have them among us. We cannot wait to experience their phenomenal folklore which will bring us closer to our origin and emotions.</p>

                    <p>One of the brightest stars in the galaxy of Indian classical music, holding our traditions high and enriching our culture, is Dr. N. Rajam. With her hands weaving magic, and her music creating history, stands strong her will to never give up. After all, a connoisseur never runs out of art and age is just but a number. 

Being born in a family of stalwarts in the field of Indian classical music, she has carved a niche for herself. Her preliminary training in carnatic music came under the guidance of her father, and later under Massuri Subramanium Iyer. Awarded with the most coveted honors, including that of the Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri, her legendary personality leaves us spellbound. She has also been the recipient of the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship in the year 2012, the utmost honor in the performing arts conferred by the Sangeet Natak Akademi (India’s National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama). Most importantly she keeps in touch with students, being a Faculty of the Performing Arts in BHU, and like an artist sculpts out pupils to follow in her footsteps. This VIRASAT, we feel highly obliged and honoured to have a woman of her calibre with us.</p>

                    <p>Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, a Grammy-winning Hindustani classical music instrumentalist, is one of India's most innovative musicians. The inventor of the Mohan Veena, a nineteen string modified archtop guitar with three melody strings, four drone strings and twelve sympathetic strings, Bhatt has created a sound that blends the western Hawaiian guitar with sitar, sarod and veena techniques.

He acquired hos flair for music from his parents, late Manmohan Bhatt and late Chandrakala Bhatt. Apart from solo performances, he is also known for fusion and pan-cultural collaborations with artists such as Taj Mahal, Bela Fleck and Jerry Douglas. International exposure such as an appearance in the 2004 Crossroads Guitar Festival allows his music to reach a larger audience, so much so that Australian musician, Lawrie Minison, mastered the art of playing Mohan Veena from him.
The first Indian musician to be presented the "Musical Scientist" award in Bangalore,India, Bhatt was praised by "Acoustic Guitar" magazine as "one of the greatest and mostly expressive slide players in the world". Besides the Grammy Award in 1993,  he has won the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award,1998, Padma Shri, 2002 and Padma Bhushan, 2017. This VIRASAT let's witness the maestro gracing the eve with his artistry.</p>

                    <p>Kathak, one of the oldest classical dance forms of India, has forever captivated us with its mesmerising footwork and graceful spins. True to its name which is derived from the Sanskrit word katha, this ancient dance form sings of the lores of valiant warriors and whirlwind romances. Encompassing the rich cultural traditions of both Hinduism and Islam, it is a magnificent amalgamation of music, dance and drama. With the evolution of different gharanas, each having its distinctive style and beauty, Kathak has been elevated to an art form of international repute. This VIRASAT we bring before you a once in a lifetime opportunity - to learn from the Kathak maestro herself, Vidushi Saswati Sen, through a three-day dance workshop. Come, experience the splendour and be a part of this remarkable enriching journey.</p>
